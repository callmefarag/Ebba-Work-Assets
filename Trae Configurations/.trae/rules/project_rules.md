The project has two installations:
    - The first is Angular 19, Under callmefarag folder.
    - The second is Sanity CMS, Under sanity folder.

1. Angular Settings
    - I use the new flow syntax. @if, @for, @let, @else, etc.
    - I don't use tests so I will need always to add --skip-tests with Angular CLI when creating stuff.
    - I use Tailwind 4, Primeng 19+.
    - I'm using Angular SSR, with new server routes for Angular 19 which is still experimental/developer preview, With Hydration.
    - I'm not using Zone.js.
    - I'm trying to learn using the <ng-template>, <ng-container>, and the other ng-template tags, So please try to use them when the context gives opportunity.
    - All API calls will be made using the new httpResource.
    - All single pages will use resolvers.
    - SEO is essential for the project, Try to keep me notified if I missed that.
    - I use tailwindcss/motion plugin and tailwindcss/intersection plugin.
    - I use signals, input/output signal based, and reactive forms.


2. Sanity Settings
    - I will use Sanity to manage my projects, case studies, and blogs.

3. Global Settings
    - When I ask for SEO Analysis, I will need you to see all the html and ts files looking for a missing essential SEO thing, Like no alt on images, no title on pages, no description on pages, etc.
    - When I ask for performance analysis, I will need you to see all the html and ts files looking for a missing essential performance thing, Like unnecessary code, unnecessary requests, code that has a better replacement.
